# Terraform in Action Implementations

This repository contains my personal implementations of the infrastructure as code (IaC) concepts and examples covered in the book "Terraform in Action" by Scott Winkler.

## Description

Each directory within this repository corresponds to a chapter or concept from the book. The code herein demonstrates the creation, testing, and management of infrastructure using Terraform, following the best practices and patterns discussed by the author.
